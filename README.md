Rapid Math Racing


What is RMR?

The goal of this project is to determine if kids can have fun playing a car race while learning basic math.
In the game, you race against a computer car while answering math questions to accelerate faster. 
The longer you spend to answer, the slower your car goes. The more correct answers, the harder math questions.
By racing, you earn coins so you can buy better cars that are faster.

Why use RMR?

Many kids donâ€™t like practicing math, which gives them bad grades and it also worries parents.
However, a majority of kids like video games and spend most of their time on it instead of practicing math. 
To fix this problem, I decided to create Rapid Math Racer, which combines Math and video games so kids can have fun while learning and improving their grades. 
Additionally, it increases their mental math skills which can help them tremendously down the road.
